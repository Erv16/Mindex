# Coding Challenge
## What's Provided
A simple [Spring Boot](https://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/) web application has been created and bootstrapped 
with data. The application contains information about all employees at a company. On application start-up, an in-memory 
Mongo database is bootstrapped with a serialized snapshot of the database. While the application runs, the data may be
accessed and mutated in the database without impacting the snapshot.

### How to Run
The application may be executed by running `gradlew bootRun`.

### How to Use
The following endpoints are available to use:
```
* CREATE
    * HTTP Method: POST 
    * URL: localhost:8080/employee
    * PAYLOAD: Employee
    * RESPONSE: Employee
* READ
    * HTTP Method: GET 
    * URL: localhost:8080/employee/{id}
    * RESPONSE: Employee
* UPDATE
    * HTTP Method: PUT 
    * URL: localhost:8080/employee/{id}
    * PAYLOAD: Employee
    * RESPONSE: Employee
```
The Employee has a JSON schema of:
```json
{
  "type":"Employee",
  "properties": {
    "employeeId": {
      "type": "string"
    },
    "firstName": {
      "type": "string"
    },
    "lastName": {
          "type": "string"
    },
    "position": {
          "type": "string"
    },
    "department": {
          "type": "string"
    },
    "directReports": {
      "type": "array",
      "items" : "string"
    }
  }
}
```
For all endpoints that require an "id" in the URL, this is the "employeeId" field.

## What to Implement
Clone or download the repository, do not fork it.

### Task 1
Create a new type, ReportingStructure, that has two properties: employee and numberOfReports.

For the field "numberOfReports", this should equal the total number of reports under a given employee. The number of 
reports is determined to be the number of directReports for an employee and all of their distinct reports. For example, 
given the following employee structure:
```
                    John Lennon
                /               \
         Paul McCartney         Ringo Starr
                               /        \
                          Pete Best     George Harrison
```
The numberOfReports for employee John Lennon (employeeId: 16a596ae-edd3-4847-99fe-c4518e82c86f) would be equal to 4. 

This new type should have a new REST endpoint created for it. This new endpoint should accept an employeeId and return 
the fully filled out ReportingStructure for the specified employeeId. The values should be computed on the fly and will 
not be persisted.

### Task 2
Create a new type, Compensation. A Compensation has the following fields: employee, salary, and effectiveDate. Create 
two new Compensation REST endpoints. One to create and one to read by employeeId. These should persist and query the 
Compensation from the persistence layer.

## Delivery
Please upload your results to a publicly accessible Git repo. Free ones are provided by Github and Bitbucket.

## Implementation Pointers

### Task 1

   * REST endpoint: /reporting/id GET request where id is the employee id whose direct reports need to be computed
   * Made use of a Set to keep track of the distinct employee direct reports based on employee id
   * Scripted a utility recursive method that calculates direct reports of sub employees if they exist and creates a nested structure providing all of the direct reports in JSON
   * Custom Exception is generated if provided employee does not exist
   * Values are computed on the fly and are not persisted as mentioned

### Task 2

   * REST endpoints: 
   * /compensation POST request to create a compensation record
   * /compensation/id GET request where id is the employee id    whose compensation request needs to be retrieved
   * /compensation/id PUT request where id is the employee id whose compensation record needs to be updated
   * Custom Exceptions are generated if employee or corresponding compensation record does not exist
   * Values are persisted in the database


* Comments are mentioned in java docs format
* REST API is documented using Swagger for Compensation and Reporting Structure
* Unit tests are written for Task 1 and 2
* Extensively tested end points using Postman
